# harvestify-crop-recommendation-system.
1)we have taken crop recommendation dataset from kaggle.
2)we did data pre-processing like checking null values,identifying and removing outliers
3)later we have plotted features on the histogram for better understanding
4)we have divided dataset into two parts train and test(percentage-80 and 20)
5)later we have used 4 machine learning models in among them random forest and xgboost gave 99% accuracy
6)by using this models we have predicted which crop should be grow in right time by using features(nitrogen,pottasium,humidity,phosphurus,ph,rainfall)
